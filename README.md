# Hi, and wellcome in to my modern_webdevelop_node section.
Almost whole code was re-written form web cours. What is the meaning of the phrase "re-write"?
In my case it's means deep understanding of "HOW IT WORK" with all dependencies involved in even single line. 
So it's possible that 5 minutes episode of web tutorial can took me 20 hours to understand.
I treat courses like collecting new skills: when I collect enough it gives me fun to creatting something.

## 5 min = 20 h ?
indeed... 5 min episode of "hello to bootstrap" took me almost 20 h of exploring. Due to diferences of v3 and v4 bootstrap library.
My cours guide [Colt Steel](https://www.udemy.com/user/coltsteele/) used stable version of that frontend package but why not to know both?

I had my trips with writing code in this course like stoping video going forward lot of code and chcecking is it working and is it "correct".



## YelpCamp was bigest project in this cours so if you interested:
how work: bodyParser, passport.js, deploying, git, router,
how to create: models, schema to your database, middleware and much more
