# Hi, and wellcome in to my modern_webdevelop_node section.
Almost whole code was rewritten form web course. What is the meaning of the phrase "rewrote"?
In my case it's means deep understanding of "HOW IT WORK" with all dependencies involved in even single line. 
So it's possible that 5 minutes episode of web tutorial can took me 20 hours to understand.
I treat courses like collecting new skills: when I collect enough it gives me fun to creating something.

## 5 min = 20 h ?
indeed... 5 min episode of "hello to bootstrap" took me almost 20 h of exploring. Due to differences of v3 and v4 bootstrap library.
My course guide [Colt Steel](https://www.udemy.com/user/coltsteele/) used stable version of that frontend package but why not to know both?

I had my trips with writing code in this course like stooping video going forward lot of code and checking is it working and is it "correct".



## YelpCamp was bigest project in this course so if you interested:
how work: bodyParser, passport.js, deploying, git, router,
how to create: models, schema to your database, middleware and much more

just check
